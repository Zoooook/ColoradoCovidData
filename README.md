This script parses data from CDPHE into an easily graphable tsv file.

There currently is not a way to automatically fetch one of the datasets, so it has to be manually grabbed from [here](https://covid19.colorado.gov/hospital-data). Click the download button under the "Number of COVID-19 patients admitted or discharged/transferred" chart, select Crosstab, and click Download.

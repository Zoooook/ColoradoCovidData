This script parses data from CDPHE into an easily graphable tsv file.

There currently is not a way to automatically fetch one of the datasets, so it has to be manually grabbed from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bjQ7LnhU8pBR3Ly63341bCULHFqc7pMw) if you want to run the script. Download the latest csv file.
